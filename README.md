# React Calculator Project

## 🌟 Overview

This is a **simple calculator application** developed as a practice project to solidify foundational knowledge in **React**. The primary goal was to implement the core mechanics of a calculator using basic React hooks and concepts.

## 🚀 Key Learning Focus

This project was specifically designed to practice and demonstrate understanding of the following essential React concepts:

* **State Management (using `useState`):** Managing the current input/result displayed on the screen and the operation being performed.
* **Component Communication (using `props`):** Passing functions and data between parent (Calculator) and child (Button) components.
* **Module Structure:** Using **`import`** and **`export`** for organizing components.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **React** (JavaScript library)
* **HTML/CSS** (For structure and styling)
* **TypeScript**
